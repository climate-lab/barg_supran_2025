# Repository for Figures published in Barg & Supran (2025)

All figures are generated the basis of our collected, coded, and cleaned data (`centers.csv` and 
`funders.csv` in the `data` folder). The code is cleaned to minimize the number of redundant 
steps etc. When annotating the code, we assumed some familiarity with the software packages we 
used.
