## ToDo

1. Parameters, input and preprocessing
2. Convert to tbl_graph and generate features
3. Generate graphical features
4. Generate layout and graph
5. Create layers
6. Build network

## 1. Parameters, input and preprocessing

```{r params}
ind_labels <- 10 # Limit labels to largest industries
large_centers <- 10
tanh_transform <- F
transform_default <- 4
edge_arc <- 0.3
edge_alpha_ff <- 0.6
edge_alpha_other <- 0.4
ff_color <- "red"
cluster_size <- 2
cluster_alpha <- 0.3
fine_grained <- F

manuscript_labels <- c("HEPG", "HEEP", "MITEI", "CEEPR", "JPSPGC", "NGI",
                       "EMF", "PATH", "EI@Haas", "EBI", "CIFE", 
                       "C-CHANGE", "RAEL", "ERG", "Woods", "BRIE", 
                       "SEA", "GCEP")

civil <- c("Universities", "Government/National Lab", "NGOs/Foundations", 
           "Individuals", "International Organizations", "Family Foundations",
           "Independent Foundations", "NGOs/Charities", "Other foundations")

label_colors = c(
  "C-CHANGE" = "#E6550DFF",
  "HEEP" = "#4DBBD5FF", 
  "JPSPGC" = "#00A087FF", 
  "MITEI" = "#3C5488FF", 
  "Woods" = "#FEB24CFF",
  "center" = "lightslategrey", 
  "funder" = "grey", 
  "ff" = "red"
)
```

```{r centers}
centers <- read_csv(here("data", "centers.csv"))
glimpse(centers)
cat("\n")
funders <- read_csv(here("data", "funders.csv"))
glimpse(funders)
```

To generate the network diagram, we first describe our data in terms of ties 
from industries to research centers.

```{r ties}
funders_aggregated <- funders %>%
  select(abbr, industry) %>%
  rename(from = industry, 
         to = abbr)
glimpse(funders_aggregated)
```

## 2. Convert to tbl_graph and generate features

Now we can generate the tbl_graph from the tidygraph package. This data format
stores the edges between industries and research centers in one dataframe, and
the attributes of each research center and industry in another dataframe. In 
subsequent steps we generate the necessary features of the nodes.

```{r graph}
graph <- funders_aggregated %>%
  # as_tbl_graph() %>%
  as_tbl_graph(directed = F) %>%
  activate('nodes') %>%
  mutate(type = if_else(name %in% funders$abbr, "center", "funder"))
glimpse(graph)
```

### a. Distinguish centers and funders

```{r graph}
graph <- funders_aggregated %>%
  as_tbl_graph() %>%
  activate('nodes') %>%
  mutate(type = if_else(name %in% funders$abbr, "center", "funder"))
glimpse(graph)
```

### b. Center attention

Merge in the number of newspaper hits on each center to scale the nodes.

```{r hits}
graph_hits <- graph %>%
  activate("nodes") %>%
  left_join(select(centers, abbr, hits), by = c("name" = "abbr"))
glimpse(graph_hits)
```

### c. Industry ties

Merge in the number of ties of each funder to scale those nodes.

```{r ties}
n_ties <- funders %>%
  group_by(industry) %>%
  summarize(ties = n())
graph_ties <- graph_hits %>%
  activate("nodes") %>%
  left_join(n_ties, by = c("name" = "industry"))
glimpse(graph_ties)
```

### d. Edge weights

We mark the first of each edges and proved the weights there to ensure that
each edge is only drawn once and transparency works as expected.

```{r edge_weights}
graph_weights <- graph_ties %>%
  activate("edges") %>%
  group_by(from, to) %>%
  mutate(edge_weight = if_else(row_number() == 1, n(), NA)) %>%
  ungroup()
glimpse(graph_weights)
```

### e. Fossil fuel nodes and edges 

Mark edges from and to fossil fuel companies, as we want to draw these in a
different color.

```{r ff_edges}
ff_nodes <- graph_weights %>%
  activate("nodes") %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>%
  filter(name %in% c("Fossil Fuel Producers", "Fossil Fuel Utilities", "Fossil Fuel Vehicle Manufacturers")) %>%
  {.$id}
graph_ff <- graph_weights %>%
  activate("nodes") %>%
  mutate(ff = name %in% c("Fossil Fuel Producers", "Fossil Fuel Utilities", "Fossil Fuel Vehicle Manufacturers")) %>%
  activate("edges") %>%
  mutate(ff = from %in% ff_nodes | to %in% ff_nodes)
glimpse(graph_ff)
```

### f. Largest centers

Add center rank as variable. We want to only label the largest five.

```{r feature_centers}
graph_highlight <- graph_ff %>%
  activate("nodes") %>%
  mutate(rank_centers = rank(-hits, ties.method = "min", 
                             na.last = "keep")) %>%
  mutate(industry_weights = if_else(type == "funder", ties, NA)) %>%
  mutate(rank_industry = rank(-industry_weights, ties.method = "min", 
                              na.last = "keep")) %>%
  mutate(rank = if_else(type == "center", rank_centers, rank_industry)) %>%
  select(-rank_centers, -rank_industry) %>%
  mutate(large_center = if_else(type == "center" & rank <= large_centers, 
                                T, F))
glimpse(graph_highlight)
```

## 3. Generate graphical features

Check that we get everything

```{r check_labels}
nodes <- graph_highlight %>% 
  as_tibble() %>%
  {.$name}
missing <- manuscript_labels[!manuscript_labels %in% nodes]
testthat::expect_equal(missing, "BRIE") # BRIE disclosed no funders
```

Prepare labels and label colors. To reduce clutter, we only label the largest
5 centers and the largest 10 funders (industries), all that show up in the 
manuscript, and all industries in the Fossil Fuel Sector.

We color centers in one color, and funders in another color. Industries in the
Fossil Fuel sector are highlighted in red, and we assign the largest five 
centers individual colors.

```{r label_colors}
graph_labels <- graph_highlight %>%
  mutate(label = case_when(
    type == "center" & rank <= 5 ~ name,
    name %in% c(manuscript_labels, civil) ~ name,
    type == "funder" & rank <= ind_labels ~ name,
    ff ~ name
  )) %>%
  mutate(label_color = case_when(type == "center" & rank <= 5 ~ name, 
                                 ff ~ "ff", 
                                 type == "center" ~ "center", 
                                 type == "funder" ~ "funder"))
glimpse(graph_labels)
```

We size the funders according to the number of unique funder--centers ties, and 
the centers according to their number of newspaper hits.

```{r size}
graph_size <- graph_labels %>%
  mutate(size = if_else(type == "center", hits, ties))
glimpse(graph_size)
```

## 4. Generate layout and graph

For better control, we gather the guides in a separate list and add them to the
finished network diagram at the end. How this works is that ggplot looks for 
guides with specific names in this list, such as `edge_width`, and if it is 
there ggplot draws the legend for edge width with the provided arguments. 
Otherwise, the legend does not show up.

```{r guides}
all_guides <- list()
```

Usually, ggplot centers the network diagram for you. We do this manually in 
advance in order to prepare for a tanh transformation that allows us to pull
the nodes in the center away from each other a bit to make space for the
labels. With trial an error, we established a minimal value that would not 
significantly change the overall appearance.

```{r create_layout}
set.seed(365)
layout <- create_layout(graph_size, layout = "fr")
mean_x <- mean(layout$x)
mean_y <- mean(layout$y)
layout$x <- layout$x - mean_x
layout$y <- layout$y - mean_y

if (tanh_transform){
  layout$x <- 4*(tanh(layout$x/transform_default))
  layout$y <- 4*(tanh(layout$y/transform_default))
}
glimpse(layout)
```

Sanity check -- overall position of nodes.

```{r graph}
graph <- ggraph(layout)
graph +
  geom_node_point() +
  labs(title = "fr")
```

## 5. Create layers

### a. Labels

Actually moved into the last code chunk, since the label position is the last
element for us to iteratively improve.

```{r geom_label, fig.width = 180/25.4, fig.height=180/25.4}
# label_layer <-
#   geom_node_label(aes(filter = !is.na(label), label = label,
#                       fill = label_color,
#                       fontface = if_else(large_center, "bold", "plain")),
#                   repel = T, size = 5/.pt, 
#                   # force = 30, force_pull = 3.5,
#                   force = 10, force_pull = 0.9,
#                   label.padding = unit(0.1, "lines"),
#                   show.legend = FALSE, seed = 132, min.segment.length = 0.2)
# graph +
#   label_layer +
#   scale_fill_manual(values = label_colors)
```

### b. Edges

This is pretty standard. The key element is to set an appropriate arc value
(in the parameters chunk at the start) such that there are not too many
straight lines overlapping but without the whole thing looking wonky.

```{r network_grap, fig.width = 180/25.4, fig.height=180/25.4}
all_guides$edge_width <- guide_legend(ncol = 2, order = 1,
                                      title = "Number of Ties")

edge_layer <- 
  c(geom_edge_arc(aes(width = edge_weight, color = ff), 
                      strength = edge_arc, alpha = edge_alpha_ff),
    scale_edge_width(range = c(0.05, 1.3), 
                     # Differences were not really visible, so we log transform:
                     trans = "log10"),
    scale_edge_colour_manual(
      values = c("black", ff_color),
      guide = "none")
      )
graph +
  edge_layer +
  guides(!!!all_guides)
```

### c. Clusters

The basic approach is to generate density estimates and then extract an
appropriate one to highlight the clusters. Then, we use the x and y-values
that describe the clusters and just draw a polygon with appropriate fill.

```{r clusters, fig.width = 180/25.4, fig.height=180/25.4}
# These first four throw warnings but work as intended anyways, 
# which is quite confusing.
ff_cluster <- graph +
  suppressWarnings(geom_density_2d(aes(filter = ff, x = x, y = y), 
                              # 2 is minimum, cluster_size is trial-and-error.
                                   bins = 2 + cluster_size))
civil_cluster <- graph +
    suppressWarnings(geom_density_2d(aes(filter = name %in% civil, 
                                         x = x, y = y), 
                                     bins = 2 + cluster_size))
ff_cluster_layer <- suppressWarnings(layer_data(ff_cluster, 1L)) %>%
    filter(level == min(level))
civil_cluster_layer <- suppressWarnings(layer_data(civil_cluster, 1L)) %>%
    filter(level == min(level))

clusters <- c(
  geom_polygon(data = ff_cluster_layer, aes(x = x, y = y), 
               fill = ff_color, alpha = cluster_alpha),
  geom_polygon(data = civil_cluster_layer, aes(x = x, y = y), 
               fill = "black", alpha = cluster_alpha), 
  geom_node_point(aes(alpha = ff), size = 0),
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c("TRUE" = cluster_alpha, 
                                "FALSE" = cluster_alpha),
                     labels = c("Fossil Fuel Sector", "Non-corporate"),
                     guid = "none")
)

graph + 
  clusters +
  guides(!!!all_guides)
```

### d. Nodes

We use the size legend for newspapers, fill for the five largest centers, and
shape to highlight funders vs. centers. Here, we generate an appropriate custom 
legend for funders. We set shapes, colors and size intervals that we want and 
run `geom_node_point` as a placeholder. Then, we extract only the legend.

```{r funder_legend}
funder_guide_shapes <- rep(23, 4)
funder_guide_color <- rep("grey", 4)
funder_guide_breaks <- c(0, 50, 100, 150)
funder_guide <- guide_legend(
  ncol = 2, order = 4,
  override.aes = list(shape = funder_guide_shapes, 
                      fill = funder_guide_color),
  title = "Number of funders"
)
funder_legend_graph <- graph +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = size)) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(0.3, 7), breaks = funder_guide_breaks) +
  guides(size = funder_guide, fill = "none", shape = "none") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = unit(7, "pt")), 
        # This is key to making the legend align with the others in the 
        # final plot.
        legend.margin = margin(0,0,0,0),
        legend.box.spacing = unit(0, "pt"))

objects <- ggplot_gtable(ggplot_build(funder_legend_graph)) 
relevant_object <- which(sapply(objects$grobs, 
                                function(x) x$name) == "guide-box") 
funder_legend <- objects$grobs[[relevant_object]]
grid::grid.newpage()
grid::grid.draw(funder_legend) 
```

Now we generate the actual nodes and use the legend for newspapers.

```{r nodes, fig.width = 180/25.4, fig.height=180/25.4}
legend_shapes <- rep(21, 4)
legend_colors <- rep("lightslategrey", 4)
legend_breaks <- c(0, 50, 100, 150)
size_guide <- guide_legend(
  ncol = 2, order = 12,
  override.aes = list(shape = legend_shapes, 
                      fill = legend_colors),
  title = "Number of\nnewspaper articles")

all_guides$size <- size_guide
all_guides$shape <- guide_legend(title = "Type", order = 3, 
                                 override.aes = list(
                                   size = 2, ncol = 1, 
                                   fill = c("lightslategrey", "grey")
                                   ))
all_guides$fill <- guide_legend(title = "Highest-profile Centers:", order = 4,
                                override.aes = list(
                                  shape = 21, size = 3
                                  ),
                                position = "bottom")

nodes <- c(
  geom_node_point(aes(size = size, shape = type, fill = label_color)),
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21, 23), 
                     labels = c("Center", "Funder")), 
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(0.3, 7), 
                        breaks = legend_breaks), 
  scale_fill_manual(values = label_colors, 
                    breaks = c("C-CHANGE", "HEEP", "JPSPGC", "MITEI", 
                               "Woods"))
)
graph +
  nodes +
  guides(!!!all_guides)
```

## 6. Build network graph

Now, we put everything together.

```{r graph, network_grap, fig.width = 180/25.4, fig.height=180/25.4}
label_layer <-
  geom_node_label(aes(filter = !is.na(label), label = label,
                      fill = label_color,
                      fontface = if_else(large_center, "bold", "plain")),
                  repel = T, size = 5/.pt, 
                  force = 30, force_pull = 3.5,
                  # force = 10, force_pull = 0.9,
                  label.padding = unit(0.1, "lines"),
                  show.legend = FALSE, seed = 132, min.segment.length = 0.2)

network_graph <- graph +
  clusters +
  edge_layer +
  nodes + 
  label_layer +
  # Add manual labels for the two clusters.
  geom_label(aes(x = 1.9, y = -0.25, label = "Fossil Fuel Sector"), 
             size = 7/.pt, label.padding = unit(0.2, "lines"),
             fill = "white",
             fontface = "bold.italic") +
  geom_label(aes(x = -3.15, y = -1.45, label = "Non-corporate sectors"), 
             size = 7/.pt, label.padding = unit(0.2, "lines"), 
             fill = "white",
             fontface = "bold.italic") +
  guides(!!!all_guides,
         custom = guide_custom(funder_legend)) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = unit(7, "pt")), 
        plot.margin = margin(b = -4, l = -1, t = 1), 
        legend.box.spacing = unit(0, "pt"))
# For the manuscript, we use .png, but final journal submission is .pdf file.
# In the .pdf we may also delete unnecessary lines between nodes and labels.
ggsave(here("out", "fr_network.png"), network_graph, dpi = 300,
       width = 180, height = 160, units = "mm")
       # width = 9, height = 9)
ggsave(here("out", "fr_network.pdf"), network_graph, dpi = 300,
       width = 180, height = 160, units = "mm")
knitr::include_graphics(here("out", "fr_network.png"))
```
